Financial and technical support will be provided in the period up to the pilot start date and will continue throughout the pilot duration.

Bikeability is the Cycling Proficiency Test for the 21st century, designed to give the next generation the skills and confidence to ride their bikes on today's roads. Whilst Bikeability is not part of the National Curriculum, under the Government's 'Travelling to school' action plan, teachers are encouraged to use Geography, Personal, Social, Health & Economic (PSHE),  Citizenship, Physical Education (PE) and other lessons to explain the benefits of sustainable travel, which includes cycling.

The training is delivered via schools during the school day to years 5-9 and available to all schools. There is also the opportunity of holiday courses where there is demand.

Level 2 Bikeability takes place on local streets, giving students a real cycling experience. They will be taught how to deal with traffic on short journeys such as cycling to school or the local shops. 

Level 3 Bikeability deals with more challenging roads and traffic situations. Level 3 training is delivered one-to-one or in groups of up to 3 so can be tailored to individual training needs, such as routes to school.  

The contract will procure the services of an external company who will provide qualified National Standard instructors to deliver the training. For Bikeability Level 2 and 3 training the company will be responsible for contacting schools to book courses, instructor scheduling, training area risk assessments and training in line with Bikeability national guidelines.

This new service will offer care and support to people in a supported living setting, where individuals will hold their own tenancies. 
The project will involve working effectively with individuals, their families and current providers to enable individuals to transition into the scheme, as well as developing and maintaining other partnerships with relevant agencies and community resources as required. There will be a strong emphasis in the service of recognising individuals' strengths, promoting independence, healthy lifestyles, active citizenship, community presence, and positive risk taking.

The service aims to maximise the long term independence of service users. The service will be delivered in the community and referrals into the service may come from Community Independence Teams, Learning Disability Teams or other representatives of  Hampshire County Council Adult Services department, in relation to drop in and telephone support, via self-referral from service users or advocacy services.

PESVA will improve the individual’s quality of life, maximise their long term independence and enable them to remain within their community.  It will focus on supporting people so they can achieve their optimum level of independence with the lowest appropriate level of sustainable support.

The Help to Live at Home Open Framework has been developed by Hampshire County Council (The Council),in conjunction with The Council's partners (the 5 Hampshire Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCG's), current providers of Homecare services), to help meet the challenges of providing Adults' home-care services over the next 5-7 years. It is an opportunity for providers to work with The Council and CCG's to develop these services in Hampshire moving forward.

The Open framework has been set up to be used for personal care and support services by both the Council and the CCG's. The services under the Open Framework cover the Council's domiciliary care requirements(including the replacement of the Care at Home service), reablement services (currently contracted as REACT),the care element of extra care and the CCGs Continuing Healthcare requirements. This is not a comprehensive list and the Open Framework will be flexible to capture emerging requirements throughout it's lifetime.

The first stage for Providers interested in delivering work through this Open Framework is to register with In-Tend and then complete an enrolment questionnaire. The enrolment questionnaire will require providers to submit details relating to their organisation which will be assessed by the Council and successful providers will be admitted onto the Open Framework. The Open framework will always be open meaning that providers can apply at any time and providers who have previously been unsuccessful may re-apply once they have taken any corrective action.

Being accepted onto the Open Framework is no guarantee of work, but will allow providers to view and tender for Call-Off contracts for both The Council and the CCG's.

Hampshire County Council intends to commission day opportunities for individuals (of sixteen years of age or older) with Learning Disabilities, Autism Spectrum Conditions, Physical Disabilities, Sensory Impairments, Mental Health Problems and other Vulnerable Adults that are based on the principles of enablement. The Council will achieve this through contractual arrangements with service providers that are based on an outcomes-focused, personalised approach.

Increasingly, people who receive social care funding wish to take up mainstream social and cultural opportunities. They want to receive support and partake in activities that are personalised and allow them to build broader social networks. Traditional day services have sometimes been less effective in enabling these sorts of opportunities. 

Day opportunity services will provide meaningful activities to service users and will support them to participate in a range of occupational, vocational and leisure activities, all designed to promote greater independence. Services will also support carers, where appropriate, by providing respite and allowing them to take a significant break from their caring responsibilities. 

Services may be delivered at a fixed location or from a location in the community; the latter may be any ordinary facility in the community that is suitable for people with disabilities and, in particular, for the needs of the individuals attending the group. Although the aims of both models of services will remain the same, the delivery method will vary according to the needs of individuals and their identified personal outcomes. 

All services will be enabling in nature and aim to build confidence and skills. The service provider will work pro-actively to incorporate an outcome-focused approach to the delivery of services. The service provider will develop systems that demonstrate outcomes to service users, commissioners and other stakeholders.

Day opportunity services may not necessarily require a dedicated building or centre. It is the function of the service in maintaining and extending social networks and access to mainstream activities that is critical.

The service may be provided and charged for in full or half day sessions, although more flexible approaches may be agreed through negotiation. Transport will be assessed separately and will be based on individual need.

The Open Framework is conducted under the ""light touch regime"" Providers interested in delivering work through this Open Framework need to register with In-Tend and then complete an enrolment questionnaire. The enrolment questionnaire will require providers to submit details relating to their organisation which will be assessed by the Council and successful providers will be admitted onto the Open Framework. The Open Framework will always be open meaning that providers can apply at any time and providers who have previously been unsuccessful may re-apply once they have taken any corrective action.
Being accepted onto the Open Framework is no guarantee of work, and service users may engage the provider for the services via the Open Framework at any time. Providers will be engaged directly by the service users and will be chosen by service user choice.

Autism Hampshire are the support provider and Radian Housing Association will be the Registered Social Landlord who will issue the tenancies and manage the property. 

The Scheme will focus on enabling the individual tenants to develop the skills and confidence to live their lives as independently as possible.  Integral to the core support will be a requirement to develop tools to enable the effective monitoring of the attainment of service specific and individual outcomes.  

The aim of Orchard House is for the provider to develop and critically evaluate a range of monitoring tools and processes specifically designed for people with complex needs associated with Autism.  In order to do this effectively, the provider will need to meaningfully engage service users living in the scheme in the evaluation of progress against outcomes.  The active engagement of people with complex needs, including those with Autism and non-verbal communication, requires a skilled staff team and the ability to critically evaluate the effectiveness of a range of methods over an extended time period. 

It is an expectation that the provider will work to promote service user independence and reduce service user dependency on paid support (the support required beyond the core support hours) by taking a proactive approach to positive risk taking, applying the principles of active support and considering assistive technology options which maximise independence.

The Scheme comprises of a large building, Lane End House, containing nine 1 bedroom flats, one 2 bedroom flat, one 3 bedroom flat and a separate on site 3 bedroom bungalow. The building also contains a communal area with kitchen, an office space and 2 sleep-in rooms, one of which is located in the bungalow and the other in the main building. The site is easily accessed by road, rail and bus and is close to Emsworth village centre which offers a range of shops and other amenities.
The scheme will ordinarily house up to 16 people who have a learning disability (the 2 bedroom flat being offered on the basis of one person, unless we have 2 people who want to share). There will be people with a range of needs occupying the service, including those with a physical disability; from those who are wheelchair users and require hoisting (accommodated in the bungalow), to some younger people with more challenging needs in some of the individual flats as well as some more independent people.
The initial phases of the project will involve working with individuals, their families and current providers to transition them into the scheme.
It is anticipated that the scheme will be operating at full, or near to full, capacity after several months. 
Once established there will be a strong emphasis in the service of promoting independence, citizenship, community presence and positive risk taking.

(iv) To enable people to develop their capacity to live independently so as to be able to maintain independent accommodation without the need for intensive support at the earliest appropriate opportunity. (v) Support people who are in housing crisis with support needs during a period of change in their life/condition/circumstances with the express aim of increasing their level of independence.
