The vehicles are to be provided through a web based portal platform by a single provider under a single supplier Framework agreement.    The aim is to deliver savings, sustainable benefits, innovation and value added benefits for the NHS, the wider public sector, and the NOE CPC, over the lifetime of the CPC Drive framework.
      A fundamental requirement is the provision of a portal that employees can access for vehicle quotations, including all personal tax implications. This portal must be CPC branded with access controlled by and at the discretion of, NOE CPC.
      Provision of Internet based portal for the delivery of: 
      1) Lease Car Schemes (Business Lease)
      2) Salary Sacrifice Cars Schemes
      
      The portal will enable public sector employers to offer their employees a direct and highly efficient means of choosing a car by manufacturer, model, specification, colour, trim and all relevant options.  The portal will enable the employee to navigate using a variety of parameters including but not limited to budget, manufacturer, body style, engine size, CO2 emissions, fuel consumption (mpg), fuel type or transmission.  The portal should be secure and accessible from any location with an internet capable device and web browser.  The portal must be capable of calculating 'real-time' quotes tailored to the employee's exact requirements and in line with the employer's policy rules and allowance calculation.  The portal will compare 'blind' quotes from a minimum of three lease car providers and display the most competitive quote to the employee in real-time. 
      
      Employees must also have sight of the potential financial commitment they would be making together with any taxation implications and impact upon their pension (where applicable).  The schemes offered should be fully compliant with all current and future legislation and HMRC rules. When quotations have been approved to an appropriate level, vehicles would then be procured through the candidates lease scheme.
      
      The portal must be able to be accessed by employees remotely and securely and be easy and intuitive to use. The framework supplier must ensure that Trusts and/or employees are advised on the latest, and fully HMRC compliant, taxation regimes.
      The period of the resulting Framework Agreement shall be four (4) years.

ESPO has established a commercial trading company, ESPO Trading Limited, whose target clients are
third sector organisations such as national and local charities, public sector mutual organisations and other organisations involved in the delivery of services to or for the public sector.

ESPO Trading Limited may enter into the second framework agreement with the successful supplier and make it available to third sector clients who themselves are not required to follow the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 or other public procurement legislation. Accordingly, this is provided for bidders' information only.
