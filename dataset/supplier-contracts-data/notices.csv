Brief Description of Requirement

A next-generation light source test facility is to be constructed at the Science and Technology Facilities Council's (STFC) Daresbury Laboratory, which will be known as CLARA (Compact Linear Accelerator for Research and Applications). The aim of the CLARA project is to develop a normal conducting test accelerator capable of generating longitudinally and transversely bright electron bunches and to use these bunches in the experimental production of stable, synchronised, ultra-short photon pulses of coherent light from a single pass FEL (Free Electron Laser) with techniques directly applicable to the future generation of light source facilities.

The Fourth Harmonic Cavity (also called X-band lineariser) of the CLARA facility is an RF cavity operating at 11994 MHz. The cavity will be powered by a 8-10 MW klystron that is pulsed at a repetition rate of 100 Hz with a pulse length of up to 2.5 μs. This pulse will be compressed using a SLED I type RF pulse compressor to 120 ns and a maximum power of 30 MW.

This specification concerns the manufacture and delivery to Daresbury Laboratory of the high power RF window requirements for the Fourth Harmonic cavity consisting of:

1. 2 X-band high power RF windows
2. Copper coated International Universal WR90 vacuum flanges brazed to window
3. Delivery to Daresbury Laboratory, Keckwick Lane, Daresbury, Warrington WA4 4AD, United Kingdom.

Please ensure you review all attached information to ensure a full understanding of this requirement. All attachments can be found with the Document Uploads tab within the Delta eSourcing Portal.

All of the procurement documents can be found here:  https://www.proactisplaza.com/supplierportal/?cid=UNIHULL","In early 2018 The University of Hull's (hereafter referred to as the University) Aura Innovation Centre (AIC) was awarded funding of £12 million from the European Regional Development Fund, Regional Growth Fund Green Port Growth Programme and match funding from the University of Hull.  The Centre is set to provide large businesses and SMEs with the space to collaborate and innovate to deliver low-carbon energy and clean growth.
    
    The England European Regional Development Fund as part of the European Structural and Investment Funds Growth Programme 2014-2020 is providing up to £4m of funding towards the AIC construction and support to SMEs. The Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government (and in London the intermediate body Greater London Authority) is the Managing Authority for European Regional Development Fund (the ""Grant Funder"").  Established by the European Union, the European Regional Development Fund helps local areas stimulate their economic development by investing in projects, which will support innovation, businesses, create jobs and local community regeneration. For more information visit https://www.gov.uk/european-growth-funding
    
    The focus of the AIC will be about providing practical support to SMEs to develop their products and services to meet the low-carbon agenda and to provide a collaborative space to facilitate the involvement of academia and large business in one space.  Its aim is to foster innovation and research to address the real challenges faced by the offshore wind and low-carbon energy industries.  It will also be about developing and rooting an effective low-carbon energy supply chain in the Energy Estuary with the ultimate goal of regenerating a region and contributing to clean growth, which is central to the UK's Industrial Strategy.
    
    When opened, the AIC will have a number of different areas and facilities to support businesses in the area to benefit from the growing supply chain. The AIC will include Business Areas and Solutions Areas as well as meeting spaces and research zones.  The equipment in the Solutions Areas will range from high spec 3D printers, big data super computer access through to metals and plastics testing equipment and product development facilities.  As the centre grows, the aim is to provide SMEs with support and advice through each of the stages of product or service development - from ideas generation through to R&D, testing, analysis and taking the product to market.

Birmingham City Council recognises that different black and minority ethnic (BAME) Communities may have specific concerns or issues resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic coupled with a limited access to the relevant official information and guidance available in community languages. We are keen to support all our local citizens to protect their health using national Government guidance (see https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus ) and maintain their wellbeing during this challenging period.
      
      Birmingham City Council's Public Health Division is tendering for additional community support services to those commissioned previously to ensure Birmingham's Languages have 
      •         awareness and understanding of COVID-19, 
      •         access to testing
      •         knowledge of how to respond if they test positive or told they are a contact of a case, 
      •         knowledge of how to reduce risk factors associated with increased risk of severe illness or death from COVID-19.
      
      We are seeking partner organisations with strong roots in Communities whose first language isn't English to work with us to share community messaging in tailored ways appropriate to their community and in multiple formats. It is important that messages around awareness and understanding of COVID-19, access to testing and knowledge of how to respond if they test positive or told they are a contact of someone who has tested positive for COVID-19 are available to citizens from these communities.
      
      Timeframe for delivery: The Public Health Division will discuss the exact timescales once tenders are evaluated. We anticipate that the programme will last no longer than 6 months, however, should             COVID 19 outbreak remain a significant issue beyond the contract period, we reserve the right to extend the operations under this contract.

**The final date and time for the submission of bids is 31/08/2020 at 11:00. DO NOT apply directly to the buyer. All tender information MUST be submitted through the Delta eSourcing Portal.**  This requirement is for the design, manufacture, delivery and installation of a Low Noise Phase Noise Analyser to be used in verifying and fault finding various components on the CLARA accelerator located at the UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) STFC Daresbury Laboratory. The UKRI- STFC is seeking to purchase a phase noise analyser system, to measure the noise performance of various CW and pulsed radio frequency systems in the carrier frequency range 3-12 GHz. The instrument will be utilised for development, debugging and maintenance of mainly but not limited to the timing distribution, synchronisation, laser, and RF acceleration systems on CLARA (Compact Linear Accelerator for Research and Applications).
The CLARA accelerator consists of many components; oscillators, timing systems, RF and laser systems that must work together to produce a very high quality electron beam. In order to meet this requirement, specific components and systems must be characterised so that sources of noise can be diagnosed and solutions implemented that reduce noise effects to a level that provides optimum machine stability. CLARA has set a target timing stability for the electron beam of <10 fs.
The RF system is locked to a 10MHz low noise oscillator that is multiplied up to many intermediate frequencies. The laser system operates at 83 MHz in pulse train mode. An ultra-stable mode-locked laser utilised in a synchronisation system under development has repetition rate of 250 MHz.  The RF reference system operates at 2998.5Mhz CW mode while other parts of the systems, in particular the high power RF system, operate in a pulsed mode (0.5-5 us pulse duration) at up to 400 Hz. The power level at different stage of the systems varies by up to 60dB, e.g. higher order harmonics extracted from laser are in range of -25dBm, while the pickoffs from high power RF system have large signals of the order of +25dBm. The noise contribution from individual components in the systems needs to be measured to debug and minimise overall system noise, requiring additive measurement capability.

This limits the extent to which policy impact on the wellbeing of rural communities and individuals can be evaluated. The requirement is to identify the particular aspects (domains) of the social and natural environment that influence the wellbeing of individuals living in rural areas. These domains will then be compared with literature on wellbeing in urban environments to identify key similarities and differences and consider how the proposed measurements of wellbeing may vary by characteristics of a rural area. These domains will be tested with rural communities to ensure they are representative of their lived experience. There will then be a review of existing data leading to a summary of suggested secondary data measures and recommendations of additional primary data collection needed, to allow for measurement of these domains pre and post policy intervention, and allow evaluators to identify the impact of a policy on rural communities. The study will discuss the implications of using the measurements it suggests for policy teams, and provide a summary of the available measures to allow rural wellbeing to be assessed. The final stage will apply the domains and their measures to rural policies and determine the feasibility of developing a rural wellbeing toolkit, and lay out any potential next steps. The toolkit would provide analysts and policymakers a means to robustly identify and measure the impact of policies on the wellbeing of rural communities, and support the 'levelling up' agenda.
A key activity underlying each iterative stage of the feasibility study will be the need to engage and test these domains of rural wellbeing with rural residents and experts, in order to ensure their relevance to rural communities and ensure their suitability for use in policy evaluation. 
The output of the study will be a report, which: 
1.	Details evidenced domains of rural wellbeing, 
2.	Suggests suitable proxy data for the measurement of each of these domains, and
3.	Identifies the feasibility of developing a rural wellbeing toolkit and outlines the next steps for developing this, taking into account policy needs.",,,"Any region","73210000 ",,mark.chamberlain@defra.gov.uk,"17 Noble House",,London,"SW1P 3JR",England,,,"Wellbeing Standard Contract Services_30535_Redacted.pdf ",,,23/10/2020,26/03/2021,05/10/2020,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,87410,,16/10/2020,87410,"[Centre for Thriving Places CIC|C/O Godfrey Wilson, 62 Prince Street, Bristol.

A total of 231 patients currently receive dialysis treatment across satellite dialysis units in these areas.

The Trust's clinical vision is that all patients dialyse in a place of their choosing, either at home or at a Renal Centre.   Wherever the location of their dialysis treatment, it should be tailored to their needs in terms of frequency and duration, to achieve best possible outcomes and symptom control.  All patients should be encouraged to be as independent as possible undertaking shared care dialysis to the limits of their ability and/or willingness.

Through the re-design and re-procurement of the Renal Dialysis service, LTH are seeking to address the following issues:
	•	11% of patients currently travel considerably longer than 30 minutes to their nearest haemodialysis service and in Cumbria this figure rises to 65%.
	•	Some services are provided in locations that are not well enough equipped to meet patient requirements such as isolation and mobility nor similar support during acute illnesses
	•	Across the region there is insufficient outpatient clinic space
	•	There are problems recruiting staff to some services which limits opening hours
	•	The way that services are currently provided is not financially viable

The Trust anticipates awarding a contract for an initial 7 years to the appointed supplier with the option of two possible further extensions, the first up to 3 years, and the second up to 4 years. 
The annual contract value is estimated at £3.7m - £4.2m per annum.

This will include NR, LU, LO and 3rd party asset monitoring and instrumentation.
      
      Scope overview
      
      This is a package to perform instrumentation & Monitoring to both the surface and underground assets within the Old Oak Common Station site and surrounding site boundary. The purpose is to:
      • Establish a baseline condition to assess behaviour of assets pre-construction.
      • Control and provide confidence in the design and construction process.
      • Verify that both ground and structures are behaving as predicted.
      • Identify any unexpected trends, anomalies and trigger responses.
      • Ensure that the impact on any existing asset does not exceed predictions.
      • Safeguard existing assets.
      • Enable post-construction state to be compared with initial baseline measurements if required by design.
      
      For reference, the assets which require monitoring based on the findings of Ground Movement Asset Reports are:
      •	Properties on Wells House Road
      •	Existing Network Rail tracks and OLE Gantries
      •	Crossrail Operations, Maintenance and Control Building
      •	Crossrail tracks and other structure associated with the Crossrail depot
      •	Existing Retaining wall between Old Oak Common Lane and the HS2 site
      •	Existing Wells House Road gravity retaining wall
      •	UK Power Networks Cable Tunnel
      •	National Grid Tunnel
      •	IEP Depot including depot building, tracks and other structures associated with the IEP depot
      •	Ground surface above or close to significant buried utilities
      •	New HS2 structures
      
      
      The indicative monitoring frequency of the listed assets will be variable, ranging from automatic, to weekly and in some instances, monthly and quarterly, depending on asset type and construction progression. Some elements of monitoring, such as Critical Rail Temperature and Track Settlement, will require real-time assessment and feedback the Employer and asset owner. It is important for respondents to this opportunity to consider their capabilities of meeting this requirement.
      
      Interested parties must be compliant with NR standards, as well as London Underground, London Overground standards for working within their managed infrastructure. This will include supply of safety critical staff.
      
      Current Main Works Programme:
      
      Monitoring and instrumentation is an emerging scope, with an estimated commencement date of April 2020. A programme of works will be issued with the Invitation to Tender to shortlisted suppliers. It is likely that there will be a requirement for monitoring presence for much of the duration of the Main Contract scope (To September 2027).
       
       Respondents to this opportunity should be advised that shortlisted applicants will be invited to tender through an external ERP system.
      
      The exact scoring criteria are currently being developed by BBVS, and shortlisted suppliers will be invited to register for the ERP system in due course.
      
      What is clear at this stage is that tenders will be scored competitively across a range of criteria, such as, but not limited to: Commercial, Programme, Methodology, HSEQ, Capability and Capacity.

North Kirklees Clinical Commissioning Group and NHS Wakefield Clinical
Commissioning Group (the CCGs).

The CCGs are inviting a number of providers to submit a quote. The CCGs wishes to
purchase what is necessary for their General Practices to be able to:
 Take images of patients' skin lesions using a contact dermatoscope
 Securely capture and upload the captured images to the General Practice held
patient electronic records
 To be able to attach an image to a suspected cancer referral to the local NHS
hospital trust.

Any submission to the CCGs must address all of the three above points, and clearly
describe the hardware and software that would be used to meet them.
The CCGs are asking that bidders - as part of their submission - attend an
event in the morning of the 6th August 2020 to showcase their proposed
solution. 

The subsequent scope is therefore for:

 The provision of 86 contact dermatoscopes, which support ease of use and high
quality image capture
 A supplier solution that is able to securely hold and transfer images taken by a
contact dermatoscope to the General Practice electronic patient record for both
SystmOne and EMIS users:
 This is to meet the storage and security requirements of the data protection
act and the NHS Digital Data Security and Protection toolkit, and to enable
clinicians to accurately compare the image/s of a patient's lesion from one
appointment to the next
 Taken images must therefore not be stored, or transferred, unencrypted on
any mobile device (either the dermatoscope, or attached mobile phone or
camera)
 The ability for a primary care clinician to be able to upload, and attach one or
more images - from the electronic patient record - to a suspected skin cancer
referral to the local NHS hospital trust, through the electronic Referral Service
(eRS):
 This should be able to provide an image/s for upload that have a file size
(compressed or not) less than 5mb in size.",,,"Yorkshire and the Humber","85000000 ","Brenda Powell",Brenda.powell1@nhs.net,"White Rose House",,Wakefield,WF11LT,England,"01484 464262",,,"www.nhssourcing.co.uk ","The tender is available on

      The aim of this project is to build on the legacy of the previous truth commission and develop a new model to become a rolling engagement model that strengthens the connection between the Council and its city partners and the citizens. 
      
      The provider organisation will be expected to work in collaboration with key stakeholders, including the local citizens, the Council, the Creating a City without Inequality Forum partners, the Birmingham Financial Inclusion Partnership and others, as appropriate as well as an academic partner. The academic partner may be sub-contracted by the provider, or other arrangements may be put in place to secure their involvement and delivery of a robust evaluation of the project and operating model of the truth commission.
      
      The provider is expected to cover the expenses for testifying commissioners and ensure that meetings are held in neutral safe spaces that are accessible and provide environments for private conversations which cannot be overheard as well as space for more open group discussions.
      
      The recruitment of the commissioners is a fundamental part of the process and key to the success of the commission and it is vital that the provider recruits people who understand the commission, what it is seeking to do and what is being asked of them. Commissioners will need to have a personal commitment to addressing poverty, inequality, and exclusion, and a desire to work together with others to that end. 
      
      Commissioners will need to be people who have things to say and stories to tell. Their stories need to come out of their lived experience of inequality and the topic focus of the commission cycle. They should understand how their experiences relate to others in their community and their city. 
      
      Commissioners need to come from a wide range of backgrounds, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, age and able bodied/disabled. The aim should be to have representatives from as many of the diverse communities of Birmingham, as possible. 
      
      This contract will be for a period of 2 years commencing 1st November 2020 until 31st October 2022.

Measuring perceptions and capturing the employee voice underpins our people strategy.

In order to achieve this goal, we are taking a preventative approach and focusing on those approaching later life (approximately people aged 50-69).

This piece of work is an important step in our organisational development. It is the first time we are tendering for a large, mixed methods piece of research that will explore in detail this life stage (there are two elements to the project with a total value of £180,000 excluding VAT).

The research will give us an overview of experiences, looking across our priority goal areas, as well as provide us with rich narratives that illustrate people's stories. The results will shape our work programmes going forward, provide us with invaluable insights that will strengthen our dissemination and influencing activities, and support others who are also interested in this exploring this life stage.

A schematic diagram of the installation should also be provided.
In addition to this each isolating valve and AVSU should be individually identified by a unique reference number. The appropriate reference number, corresponding to that shown on the drawings, should be displayed at or on each isolating valve. The drawing should indicate the type and make of terminal units.
The Trust therefore requires fixed costs for the following:
1.	Provision of a full set of 'As-Fitted' drawings of the medical gas pipeline systems
2.	A full set of schematic drawings of each medical gas system including AGSS
3.	A full set of isometric drawings of each medical gas system including flow rates
4.	Each isolating valve and AVSU to be fitted with a Traffolyte tag/label with a unique reference number and in accordance to HTM02-01 Appendix K.
5.	Install new valve locks to existing Line valves.
6.	Verify all existing AVSU keys and replace any missing as required.

"QU339 - AWARD",Contract,"Birmingham City Council",Awarded,2020-10-20T09:40:17Z,"QU339 - Children and Young People's messages for Covid-19 Campaign  - AWARD","COVID-19 has disrupted the life of every child. The UK government has implemented measures to tackle this serious public health crisis, including closing schools (except for children of key workers and the most vulnerable children who have social workers) and enforcing social distancing. However, it is important to recognise the impact on children and young people, particularly those in low-income families or living in poverty. School closures, while an important way to stave the spread of COVID-19, may have resulted in increased social isolation for young people. 
      
      Government guidance advocating social distancing and social isolation for those that are unwell, may lead to increased feelings of loneliness among children and young people which is already an issue and may negatively impact on their wellbeing. Returning to school may also have its own issues for children and young people. 
      
      Children of different age groups have differing needs and complexity of receiving messages to support:
      •         awareness and understanding of COVID-19, 
      •         access to testing
      •         knowledge of how to respond if they test positive or told they are a contact of a case, 
      •         knowledge of how to reduce risk factors associated with increased risk of severe illness or death from COVID-19
      
      To better support the needs of the differing age groups this tender has been broken into Children and Young People categories:
      
      Lot A:            Early Years
      Lot B:            Primary
      Lot C:           Secondary
      Lot D:           Young People under 25 years to encompass those in receipt of benefits
      
      We are seeking applicant organisations to highlight relevant and innovative methods they intend to adopt to enable information to be shared with children and young people using appropriate methods according to their age groups. This may be through social media or other relevant resources as required, digital or non digital. It is important that the needs of all children across Birmingham is considered in this tender.

As ITIL is so broad it may be the case that the selected supplier allocates different specialists for different parts of the framework.
      In addition to providing service management expertise, the Service Management Partner will provide PRINCE2 management, the Combined Authority will provide a Project Assistant to give support and internal co-ordination. The partner will be required to deliver a PID within three weeks of the project commencing which will require sign-off from the ICT Management Board which this project reports to.
      Much of this work will involve engagement with senior Combined Authority staff outside ICT Services to develop essential service management requirements such as service and operational level agreements. Here, the Service Management Partner will confidently lead workshops with heads of service and directors whilst closely involving ICT Services staff. 
      Although it is not expected that the partner will write every SLA and OLA, they will lead the production of an agreed selection, train and develop Combined Authority staff to continue this work using their recommended approach and then have overall responsibility for the completion of the remaining agreements which will be delegated to Combined Authority staff under the partner's direction.
      It is important that the Service Management Partner is pragmatic and adaptable. The Combined Authority requires practical help with the introduction of service management techniques which will make a visible and rapid difference to how ICT services are delivered. The Combined Authority does not want a partner to undertake a theoretical exercise or to expand on the benefits of service management.",,"LS1 2DE","Yorkshire and the Humber","72000000 ","Matthew Hoyle",Matthew.Hoyle@westyorks-ca.gov.uk,"40-50 Wellington Street",Leeds,"West Yorkshire","LS1 2DE","United Kingdom",+441133481081,www.westyorks-ca.gov.uk,,,,12/10/2020,11/10/2021,10/08/2020,NO,,Yes,No,No,Services,140000,150000,22/09/2020,119000,"[Pink Elephant EMEA Ltd|Central Point 25-31 London Road, Reading, Berkshire, United Kingdom, RG1 4BS|NONE||No|No]","Emily Lawrence",12/10/2020,11/10/2021,"Open ",,12:00

The Programme will see the creation of a series of peer networks (cohorts) through the Growth Hub network, with each group consisting of 11 owners or managers from the SME business community participating in each network.  Led by an experienced Facilitator, these Peer Networks will typically meet fortnightly as part of delivering 18 hours of action learning through 2-3-hour sessions.  Individual one-to-one support (coaching, mentoring, or advice) will also be provided directly by the Programme, to help to implement and manage change.  Active involvement in the Peer Network will enhance the leadership capabilities, knowledge and confidence of business owners and entrepreneurs within a local region.  It will help build regional connectivity and strength within the SME business community.

To ensure successful delivery the facilitator has three main strands of responsibility:

•	Management and direction of their individual peer network(s) and its successful facilitation using the principles of action learning 

•	Individual one-to-one communication with each participant to support reflection and provide signposting to the most appropriate local support
